			The most apparent reason to leave your home country is the search a better life. This visualization takes a look at what people say is most important to them in life and how this reflects in their choice for a new home. It thereby also raises the question how other aspects, like distance, language and immigration laws, affect the decision.<br/><br/>Seeking a Better Life is based on the <a href="http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/">OECD Better Life Index</a>, the <a href="http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/responses/">user responses</a> on which topics matter most and the 2012 foreign population inflow statistics from the <a href="http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=MIG">International Migration Database</a>.<br/>Concept, Design and Code by <a href="http://fidelthomet.com/">Fidel Thomet</a>.<br/>

			In 2012 most Brazilian emigrants moved to Portugal. Education, health and life satisfaction (represented by the green, purple and orange dots) are the three Better Life Index topics most relevant to the Brazilian population. However, the score of Portugal (represented by the multicolored polygon) in those topics is not very high.<br/><br/>As the Better Life Index of Portugal doesn't really fit what Brazilians say is most important to them, Portugal is a relatively low match to them. Whereas countries like the United States or Australia are a much better match. 
			<br/><br/>
			Most likely the common language with Portugal influences many Brazilian emigrants in their search for a new home.
